- "aliensrc" inside alienmatcher.json should be exactly the same as in
  .aliensrc, maybe we could already create all information during .aliensrc
  creation and then just copy it into alienmatcher results
- .aliensrc misses the "tool" json header
- all debug and info outputs should have a clnpath or abspath? We need to decide a strategy here
- create models for each JSON
